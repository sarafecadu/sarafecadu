👋🏽 Hi, I'm Sara Fecadu

I spend my weekdays writing software for Amazon. 

Currently reading [Kill it with Fire](https://nostarch.com/kill-it-fire) and [Seven Databases in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/titles/pwrdata/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks-second-edition/). 

No side projects at the moment.
