👋🏽 Hi, I'm Sara Fecadu

I spend my weekdays writing software for Amazon. 

Currently reading [Web Security for Developers](https://nostarch.com/websecurity), [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/working-effectively-with/0131177052/), and [Kill it with Fire](https://nostarch.com/kill-it-fire). 

No side projects at the moment.
